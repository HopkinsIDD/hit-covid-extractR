Description: Loads the HIT-COVID database and contains functions to filter and visualize the intervention data and pair it with epidemiological information. The Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 (HIT-COVID) project tracks the implementation and relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSMs) taken by governments to slow transmission of SARS-COV-2 globally. Each change in policy and corresponding date is documented at the first-level  administrative unit (e.g., states, districts) and nationally for all countries with more detailed  geographic resolution in some locations (e.g., counties in the US). For a detailed description of the methods see Zheng et al. (2020) <doi:10.1038/s41597-020-00610-2>.
