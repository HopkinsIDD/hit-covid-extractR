# hitRcovid: Access and Visualize the HIT-COVID Database

### *Under development*

## Database background

The Health Intervention Tracking for COVID-19 (HIT-COVID) project tracks the implementation and relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSMs) taken by governments to slow transmission of SARS-COV-2 globally. Hundreds of volunteer data contributors were trained, provided with standardized field definitions and access to an online forum for asking questions and sharing ideas. Each change in policy and corresponding date is documented at the first-level administrative unit (e.g., states, districts) and nationally for all countries with more detailed geographic resolution in some locations (e.g., counties in the US).

Data are entered into a structured questionnaire with a source document(s) required for each record. Source documents from official government sources are preferred, but other sources are permitted when official sources are unavailable. For each intervention, HIT-COVID captures a suite of additional data including whether interventions are required or recommended and the particular subpopulation to which policies apply. To ensure data quality, contributors are asked to complete weekly self-audit reports, have the ability to submit corrections on past entries, and the management team performs geographic or intervention-specific audits as issues arise. 

This package can be used to easily access, filter, and visualize the HIT-COVID database. The database including detailed documentation is available in the [hit-covid repository](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/hit-covid) and more details can be found on the [website](https://akuko.io/post/covid-intervention-tracking).
